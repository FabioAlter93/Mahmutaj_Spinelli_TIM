# Mahmutaj_Spinelli_TIM
Project of Hypermedia application

We used html, css, php and javascript.
We populated the DB with phpMyAdmin.
We used in particular bootstrap for the header/footer part.

We encountered lots of problems and so our technology implementation is simplier than the mockup one and we missed to implement parts like "promotions" (we know it would be everywhere as a landmark like in the mockups but we hadn't the time).

king regards,

Fabio and Claudia.

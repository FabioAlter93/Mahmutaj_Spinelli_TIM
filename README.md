# Mahmutaj_Spinelli_TIM
Project of Hypermedia application

We used html, css, php and javascript.
We populated the DB with phpMyAdmin.
We used in particular bootstrap for the header/footer part.

We encountered lots of problems and so our technology implementation is simplier than the mockup one and we missed to implement parts like "promotions" (we know it would be everywhere as a landmark like in the mockups but we hadn't the time).
We also preferred to put smartlife services related to a products and assistance services related to a product directly in the product page, we know it's different from the p-idm that requires an addictional page for related service but we found it simplier and more "elegant2 to put it directly there.

Hope you'll condider that our mistakes aren't real mistakes but are maden consciously because due to lots of exams in this session we hadn't enough time. 

ps. we know it's surely our fault but we wanted just to advise you of this "missed" content and it's reason.
thanks.

king regards,

Fabio and Claudia.
